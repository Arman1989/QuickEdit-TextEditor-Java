# QuickEdit-TextEditor-Java
This is a source code for a text editor made using java with password security for files created and saved by the editor. 

The main file is QuickEdit.java so if you want to run the code run this file and all other files that are the packages with implementation 
details for several operations like find,replace save ,save as everything is in folder EditorTools.

The best thing about out editor is that it is a secured editor which saves each of its file with a password such that no intruder can read the file unless he /she has thepassword. 

If you try to open this file with any other editor you would see an encrypted data.This will help to keep the data secured .

Also there would be a commit for executable jar file named QuickEdit.jar. TO execute this jar file you need a java runtime environment with class file version 57.0 and above.

This editor incorporates new functioniality to replace a string only . It is found in most of the editors that in most of the editors the replace functionality replaces all the strings and substings same as the entered input with the required output. We provide an functionality to replace the given strings only matching the input pattern or to replace both strings and sub-strings matching the input with the required output.

Example is like if the text is  "This is a document" and you try to replace the word "is" ,only "is" word will be replaced and not the substring "is" in the string "This". If you run replace all function then both the string "is" and substring "is" of string "This" will get replaced.
